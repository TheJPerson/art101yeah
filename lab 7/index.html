			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Writing functions that effectively take user input to create the intended output.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The code to create the function was not too problematic, as the instructions on Canvas were very clear and concise. Styling the output text over the image was a bit of a challenge, but I sorted it out eventually. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was pretty fun, though perhaps not in the way it was intended to be. The Java Script was not too difficult to implement, but the subsequent formatting of the image used to contain the output text was a bit of a challenge, but a fun one. Though it took a while to implement, it was quite fulfilling to figure it out.</p>
