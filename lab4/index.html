			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create psuedocode in javascript in a manner viable for guiding future coding projects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Mostly just figuring out how to word instructions so as not to make them too convoluted, while also splitting the tasks up appropriately. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was quite interesting, and I am curious to see what we will do next with pseudocoding as a guiding list. Though this lab was relatively simple, it did instill a bit of worry in me, particularly in considering the future of figuring out how to actually code the instructions made for such a seemingly simple game. However, such a prospect is nonetheless exciting. </p>

			<pre><code>
			//Create board (15 x 15)
			//Create player character (1 tile in size) 
				//Set player in center of board
			//Create consumable item on random board tile 
				//When consumable item is touched it disappears
				//Add one tile of length to player one opposite end of where they were facing
			//Allow player to move one tile at a time
			//Generate new consumable item
			//If player hits wall or self they lose
