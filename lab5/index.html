			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Establish and define variables in Java Script in the proper formatting for functionality.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem that occured during this lab was figuring out how to format the JS so that it would actually appear in text form on this site. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was not too difficult, though there were a few issues I had to work out before the Java Script worked on this site. I do find it interesting that you have to add an extra " " if you want to add a space between words. </p>
